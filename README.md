# CTRDL

Implementation of common `dl*` APIs, along with custom additions, which can be used for loading and executing ELF files on the Nintendo 3DS.

## Build

Download a [prebuilt](https://github.com/kynex7510/CTRDL/releases) version, use as a CMake dependency, or build manually:

```sh
# Setup ResGen
cmake -B Build/ResGen -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ResGen
cmake --build Build/ResGen --config Release
cmake --install Build/ResGen --prefix Build/ResGen/Release

# Build library + tests
cmake -B Build -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$DEVKITPRO/cmake/3DS.cmake" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DRESGEN_PATH="$(pwd)/Build/ResGen/Release/bin"
cmake --build Build --config Release
cmake --install Build --prefix Build/Release
```

## Symbol resolution

Since all homebrew is statically linked by default, there's no way for a program to expose symbols to shared objects. This behaviour can be simulated by redeclaring `ctrdlProgramResolver`, which is called internally whenever a symbol has to be looked up in a program, or its dependencies. By default `ctrdlProgramResolver` returns `NULL` for any input.

Additionally, a custom resolver can be passed to the extensions `ctrdlOpen`, `ctrdlFOpen`, `ctrdlMap`, which will be used at the relocation step, and which always precedes other lookup mechanisms (`dlsym` is not affected).

Finally, the [ResGen](ResGen/README.md) tool can be used during build steps to automatically generate a resolver for specific libraries. See [README.md](ResGen/README.md) for more info and [Tests](Tests/Libs/CMakeLists.txt) for usage examples.

## Limitations

- `RTLD_LAZY`, `RTLD_DEEPBIND`, and `RTLD_NODELETE` are not supported.
